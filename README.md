# termshort

A CLI to screenshot screen on Windows.

This is a pet project which I built to learn C; use with care ðŸ˜œ.

## Building

This project using [Meson Build System](https://meson.build), you can simply build this
project as anyother meson project. This project only runs on Windows, and maybe in the
future support for other platforms would be added.

There's also a [CI script](https://github.com/naveen521kk/termshort/blob/main/.github/workflows/build.yml#L3)
that you can look into.
